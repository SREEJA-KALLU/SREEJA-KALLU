This project focuses on leveraging IoT technology to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling real-time monitoring of patient vitals and providing remote medical consultations. Using sensors such as pulse oximeters and temperature sensors, the platform collects critical health data and transmits it securely to a central database via a Wi-Fi module. The data is then analyzed and made accessible to healthcare providers through a telemedicine interface, facilitating remote diagnosis, medication management, and follow-up care. This scalable solution enhances patient accessibility to medical services, especially in remote areas, while ensuring data privacy and system interoperability.
